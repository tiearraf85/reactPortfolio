# GITIGNORE FILE - This tells Git which files to IGNORE when saving your project
# Think of this like a "Do Not Include" list when backing up your project
# Git won't save these files to your repository (online backup)

# ===== LOG FILES =====
# These are files that record what happened while your app was running
# We don't save these because they're temporary and change constantly
logs                    # General log folder
*.log                   # Any file ending in .log (like error.log, debug.log)
npm-debug.log*          # NPM package manager error logs
yarn-debug.log*         # Yarn package manager error logs
yarn-error.log*         # Yarn package manager error files
pnpm-debug.log*         # PNPM package manager error logs
lerna-debug.log*        # Lerna monorepo tool error logs

# ===== DEPENDENCIES AND BUILD FILES =====
# These folders/files are created automatically - no need to save them
node_modules            # Folder with all your downloaded packages (HUGE folder - don't save!)
dist                    # Built/compiled version of your website (created by npm run build)
dist-ssr               # Server-side rendered build files (advanced build output)
*.local                 # Local configuration files (personal settings)

# ===== EDITOR DIRECTORIES AND FILES =====
# These are files created by code editors - personal preferences, not part of the project
.vscode/*               # VS Code editor settings folder
!.vscode/extensions.json # EXCEPTION: Do save the recommended extensions list
.idea                   # IntelliJ/WebStorm editor settings
.DS_Store               # Mac system file (creates automatically on Mac computers)
*.suo                   # Visual Studio solution user options
*.ntvs*                 # Node.js Tools for Visual Studio files
*.njsproj               # Node.js project files
*.sln                   # Visual Studio solution files
*.sw?                   # Vim editor swap files (temporary files while editing)
