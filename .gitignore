# GITIGNORE FILE - This tells Git which files to IGNORE when saving your project
# Think of this like a "Do Not Include" list when backing up your project
# Git won't save these files to your repository (online backup)

# ===== LOG FILES =====
# These are files that record what happened while your app was running
# We don't save these because they're temporary and change constantly
